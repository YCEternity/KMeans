# Introduction
This is the homework of the course AI(Artificial Intelligence):  
 
# Prerequisites
Python 3.6  
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 0.23.2  
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 1.1.4  
[pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) 8.0.1  
OTHERS - Such as numpy, csv and random, .e.t 
# Descriptions
**Task 1** - Use KMeans to cluster the points that generated by random.  
* ```Dataset```: Using random function to generate some points. 
* ```Instruction```: The points(Xi, Yi) are puts in the two lists. Then, function writerow() is called to save the points. In the last, using KMeans as other ML algorithms in the pipelined way. 

**Task 2** - Use KMeans to cluster the picture that by its pixel.  
* ```Dataset```: Any pictures. 
* ```Instruction```: Generating the same number of gray values according with the K value. 

# Usage
run KMeans_point.py for task 1
    KMeans_picture.py for task 2
